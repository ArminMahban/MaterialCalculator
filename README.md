# MaterialCalculator
iphone 6/6s calculator written in Swift. Inspired by Google's material design 

Features:
- Dynamic calculations
- Calculation history 
- 5 preset color themes!

Note: App is set to only work on iPhone 6/6s and 6/6s simulators. This is mainly due to proper constraints not being configured for the other screen sizes.

Thanks for checking this out!
